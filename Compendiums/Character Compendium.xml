<subclass baseclass="Druid">
		<name>Druid (Shepherd)</name>
		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Shepherd</name>
				<text>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey.</text>
				<text>	Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds. Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of the Shepherd: Speech of the Woods</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.</text>
				<text>	You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you any special friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of the Shepherd: Spirit Totem</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call forth nature spirits and use them to influence the world around you.</text>
				<text>As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents. As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.</text>
				<text>	The spirit persists for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>	The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Bear Spirit. The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Hawk Spirit. The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Unicorn Spirit. The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="6">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of the Shepherd: Mighty Summoner</name>
				<text>Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:</text>
				<text />
				<text>• The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.</text>
				<text>• The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="10">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of the Shepherd: Guardian Spirit</name>
				<text>Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="14">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of the Shepherd: Faithful Summons</name>
				<text>Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of Conjure Animals as if it were cast with a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).</text>
				<text>	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</text>

				<text>The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them.

				<name>Artillerist: Arcane Turret</name>
				<text>Arcane Turret</text>
				<text>At 3rd level, you learn how to create a magical  turret. With your smith's tools in hand, you can  take an action to magically summon a Medium  turret in an unoccupied space on a horizontal  surface within 5 feet of you.</text>
				<text>	The turret is a magical object that occupies its  space and that has crablike legs. It has an AC of  18 and a number of hit points equal to five times  your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it  is forced to make an ability check or a saving  throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the  mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit  points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit  points or after 10 minutes. You can dismiss it  early as an action.</text>
				<text>	When you summon the turret, you decide  which type it is, choosing from the options on  the Arcane Turrets table. On each of your turns,  you can take a bonus action to cause the turret to  activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of  the same action, you can direct the turret to walk  or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space.</text>
				<text>	You can summon a turret once for free and  must finish a long rest before doing so again. You  can also summon the turret by expending a spell  slot of 1st level or higher. If you summon a  second turret, the first turret disappears.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you can command your turret to  detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so  destroys the turret and forces each creature  within 10 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving  throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d6  force damage on a failed save or half as much  damage on a successful one.</text>

				<text>Arcane Turrets</text>
				<text>Turret            Activation</text>
				<text>Flamethrower      The turret exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 1d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</text>
				<text>Force Ballista    Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the turret, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the turret.</text>
				<text>Defender          The turret emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</text>

				<text>By 6th level, you now regularly experiment with channeling different types of magic through wands. Whenever you finish a long rest and your woodcarver's tools are with you, you can touch a nonmagical, wooden wand and turn it into a magic item. When you do so, you invest it with one artificer cantrip of your choice—even one you don't know—that has a casting time of 1 action. As an action, you can cause the magicwand to produce the cantrip, using your spellcasting ability modifier (other creatures are unable to use the wand's magic). The wand loses this magic when you finish your next long rest.</text>
				<text>	Any damage roll you make for a cantrip in the wand gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</text>

				<text>	You can also now summon a second turret for free and must finish a long rest before doing so again. If you summon the second turret while the first is still present, the first one doesn't disappear, and each turret can be of a different type (if you summon a third turret, the first turret vanishes).

				<name>Arcane Tradition: Lore Mastery (UA)</name>
				<text>Lore Mastery is an arcane tradition fixated on understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it. Some savants take a haughty attitude toward those who follow a tradition focused on a single school of magic, seeing them as provincial and lacking the sophistication needed to master true magic. Other savants are generous teachers, countering ignorance and deception with deep knowledge and good humor.</text>
			</feature>

				<name>Lore Master</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you become a compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skill if you are proficient in that skill.</text>
				<text>	In addition, your analytical abilities are so well-honed that your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice).</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Spell Secrets</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you master the first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies.</text>
				<text>	When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). You replace one energy type for another by altering the spell's formula as you cast it.</text>
				<text>When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Altering Spells:</text>
				<text>While the Spell Secrets feature offers increased
versatility, at the table its effects can be difficult to spot by the other players. If you're playing a savant, take a moment to describe how you alter your spells. Think of a signature change your character is particularly proud of. Be inventive, and make the game more fun for everyone by playing up the sudden, unexpected tricks you character can employ. For example, a fireball transformed to require a Strength save might become a sphere of burning rock that shatters and slams into its target. A charm person that requires a Constitution save might take the form of a vaporous narcotic that alters the target's mood.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Alchemical Casting</name>
				<text>At 6th level, you learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic into your spell to amplify it. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.</text>
				<text>• An additional 1st-level spell slot can increase the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase the damage against every target by 2d10 force damage. If the spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell.</text>
				<text>• An additional 2nd-level spell slot can increase the spell's range. If the spell's range is at least 30 feet, it becomes 1 mile.</text>
				<text>• An additional 3rd-level spell slot can increase the spell's potency. Increase the spell's save DC by 2.</text>

The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustn't have it prepared, and you follow the normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot.

				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Divine Soul</name>
				<text>Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god's name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</text>
				<text>	A Divine Soul, with natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands celestial power, these sorcerers can undermine the existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.</text>
				<text>	In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.</text>

Water parts to allow a ship to sail over it or a diver to plunge into it, but their passing leaves no mark. Water flowing down a mountain reaches the sea.

				<text>	When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage) and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage dealt by the tentacle increases to 2d8.</text>
				<text>	As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack.</text>

For 1 minute, a translucent maw manifests in a 10-foot radius centered on that point. Each creature in that area when the maw appears must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be restrained. Any creature that starts its turn in the maw's area takes 3d6 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage). As an action, a restrained creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the restraint on a success.

As an action, you choose a point within 30 feet of you where your patron tears through reality, manifesting a measure of its thalassic grandeur. Choose one of the following effects to issue from this manifestation point. Once you use either effect, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	Transport. You and up to five willing creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point are grasped by spectral tentacles and yanked through your patron's realm. The tentacles teleport you and the chosen creatures to a point of your choice within 100 miles that you have visited within the past 24 hours. The tentacles then vanish.</text>
				<text>	Fury. You can direct a barrage of spectral tentacles to issue forth and strike up to five creatures you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 cold or lightning damage (your choice) and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone. The tentacles then vanish.</text>

				<text>Using Superiority Dice:</text>

				<text>• When you make a check that allows you to apply your proficiency in Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth, or Survival, you can expend one superiority die to bolster the check. Add half the number rolled on the superiority die (rounding up) to your check. You apply this bonus after making the check but before learning if it was successful.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• If you are hit by an attack while wearing light or medium armor, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your AC. If the attack still hits, you take half damage from it.</text>

				<text>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.</text>

			<text>The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and ex- plosive blasts.

If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from the repercussions.</text>

				<name>Divine Sense</name>
				<text>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</text>

				<text>	As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</text>
				<text>	Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>

				<name>Psionics</name>
				<text>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines, the rules for which appear at the end of this document. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psionic Talents</name>
				<text>A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels.  The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psionic Disciplines</name>
				<text>A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time.</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.</text>
				<text>	In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psi Points</name>
				<text>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.</text>
				<text>	The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psi Limit</name>
				<text>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.</text>

				<text>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline's description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.</text>
				<text>	You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psionic Ability</name>
				<text>Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Discipline save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text>	Discipline attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Using Disciplines</name>
				<text>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.</text>
				<text>	The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Psychic Focus</text>
				<text>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Effect Options and Psi Points</text>
				<text>A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.</text>
				<text>	Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can't decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.</text>
				<text>	Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Components</text>
				<text>Disciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Duration</text>
				<text>	An option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts. Instantaneous: If no duration is specified, the effect of an option is instantaneous. Concentration: Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with "Conc" after the option's psi point cost. The "Conc" notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says "Conc 1m", you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute, if an option says "Conc 1h", you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 hour, and finally if an option says "Conc 1r", you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 round.</text>
				<text>	Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can't concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. See chapter 10, "Spellcasting", in the Player's Handbook for how concentration works.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Targets and Areas of Effect</text>
				<text>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect. See chapter 10, "Spellcasting", of the Player's Handbook.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</text>
				<text>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.</text>
				<text>Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Combining Psionic Effects</text>
				<text>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of those disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a single psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if that option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect — usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect — applies while the durations of the effects overlap.</text>
				<text>	Psionics and magic are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule (see "Psionics and Magic" earlier, as well as "Combining Magical Effects" in chapter 10, "Spellcasting", of the Player's Handbook).</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Stone Sorcery (UA)</name>
				<text>Your magic springs from a mystical link between your soul and the magic of elemental earth. You might trace a distant ancestor to the Plane of Earth, or your family might have earned a mighty boon in return for a service to the dao lords. Whatever your past, the magic of elemental earth is yours to command.</text>
				<text>	Your link to earth magic grants you extraordinary resilience, and stone sorcerers have a natural affinity for combat. A steel blade feels like a natural extension of your body, and sorcerers with this origin have a knack for wielding both shields and weapons. In combat your place is amid the fray. You rely on your elemental nature to shield you from harm and your magic and metal weapons to overwhelm your foes.</text>
				<text />
				<text>This sorcerous Origin is from Unearthed Arcana: Sorcerer and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this class option.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Stone Sorcery: Metal Magic</name>
				<text>Your affinity for metal gives you the option to learn some non-sorcerer spells that focus on weapon attacks. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can select the spell from the following list of spells, in addition to the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</text>
				<text />
				<text>1st — compelled duel</text>

				<text>	As an action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Constitution modifier if you aren't wearing armor, and your skin assumes a stony appearance. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield.</text>

				<name>Stone Sorcery: Stone Aegis</name>
				<text>Starting at 6th level, your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness it for your allies' protection:</text>
				<text />
				<text>	As a bonus action, you can grant an aegis to one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The aegis is a dim, gray aura of earth magic that protects the target.</text>
				<text>	Any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2 + your sorcerer level divided by 4.</text>
				<text>	This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	In addition, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker.</text>
				<text>	You can teleport only if you and the attacker are on the same surface.</text>
				<text>	You can then make one melee weapon attack against the attacker.</text>
				<text>If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d10 force damage. This extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 17th level.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Bardic Inspiration</name>
				<text>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</text>
				<text>	Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</text>
				<text>	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
				<text>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</text>
				<text>	You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting</text>
				<text>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</text>

		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Phoenix Sorcery (UA)</name>
				<text>Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix's power dwells within you.</text>
				<text>	That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can't bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.</text>
				<text>	More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.</text>
				<text>	Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.</text>

				<name>Archivist: Artificial Mind</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you discover how to awaken a mind inside an object. Whenever you finish a long rest and your calligrapher's supplies are with you, you can magically rouse a keen mind within a Tiny, nonmagical object on which you write mystical symbols. The object is a magic item while the mind is inside it, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus. If you already have an artificial mind from this feature, the first one immediately dissipates.</text>
				<text>	The magic item has the following properties.</text>
				<text>	Telepathic Advisor. The artificial mind telepathically supplies you with advice and information about certain topics: while the item is on your person, you have proficiency in two skills of your choice; the item's main material determines which skills you can choose from, as shown on the Artificial Mind table in the Skill Proficiencies column, for the nature of the object affects the mind's knowledge.</text>
				<text>	Manifest Mind. As a bonus action while the item is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral presence, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This presence is intangible and invulnerable, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. You determine its appearance; the Artificial Mind table offers suggested appearances based on the object's main material.</text>
				<text>	While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. As an action, you can hear and see using the mind's senses, instead of your own, until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).</text>
				<text>	As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from its magic item or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.</text>
				<text>	When you cast an artificer spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (at least once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	Information Overload. As an action while the item is on your person, you can try to magically overload the thoughts of one creature you or the mind can see that is within 5 feet of the manifested mind, channeling a jumble of information from the artificial mind. Unless the target succeeds on an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the next attack roll against it before the end of your next turn has advantage, since it is temporarily too distracted to defend itself well. The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8) in this class.</text>
				<text>	Whenever you deal damage with this feature, you can expend a spell slot to deal extra damage to the target. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than first.</text>

This form has the capacity to be a force of good or destruction, with some monasteries training students to either temper their nature or embrace their impulses. </text>

				<text>	While your astral arms are summoned, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text>• You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
				<text>• The arms are monk weapons and have a reach of 10 feet. The arms deal radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you attack with the arms, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</text>
				<text>• Immediately after you use the Attack action with your astral arms on your turn, you can make one extra attack with your astral arms as a bonus action. The number of extra attacks increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to two at 11th level and three at 17th level.</text>

				<name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Kensei</name>
				<text>Monks of the Way of Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point that the weapon becomes like an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.</text>
				<text>A kensei sees a weapon much in the same way a calligrapher or a painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Way of the Kensei: Path of the Kensei</name>
				<text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instruction in the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Kensei Weapons. Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon – either melee or ranged – to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Agile Parry. If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Kensei's Shot. You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</text>
				<text>	Way of the Brush. You gain proficiency with your choice of calligrapher's supplies or painter's supplies.</text>

				<name>Way of the Kensei: One with the Blade</name>
				<text>At 6th level, you extend your ki into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Magic Kensei Weapons. Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Deft Strike. When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.</text>

As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 ki points to grant one kensei weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of ki points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on a magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.</text>

			<name>Seasons</name>
			<text>Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated witb one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin's mood:</text>
			<text>	Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.</text>
			<text>	Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.</text>
			<text>	Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes.</text>
			<text>	Summer is the season of boldness and aggression. a time of unfettered energy.</text>
			<text>	Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season.</text>
			<text />
			<text>When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.</text>
			<text>	The following tables offer personality suggestions for eladrin of each season. You can roll on the tables or use them as inspiration for characteristics of your own.</text>
			<text>	AUTUMN</text>

			<text>	without such comforts.</text>

			<text>	1  You trust others without a second thought.</text>
			<text>	2  You give to others, to the point that you leave yourself without necessary supplies.</text>

			<text />
			<text>	WINTER</text>

			<text>	4  A penny spent is a penny lost forever.</text>
			<text>	Winter Flaw</text>
			<text>	1  Everything dies eventually. Why bother building anything that is supposedly meant to last?</text>
			<text>	2  Nothing matters to you, and you allow others to guide your actions.</text>
			<text>	3  Your needs come first. In winter, all must watch out for themselves.</text>

			<text>	d4 Summer Personality Trait</text>
			<text>	1  You believe that direct confrontation is the best way to solve problems.</text>

			<text>	3  You stand tall and strong so that others can lean on you.</text>
			<text>	4  You maintain an intimidating front. It's better to prevent fights with a show offorce than to harm others.</text>
			<text>	d4 Summer Flaw</text>
			<text>	1  You are stubborn. Let others change.</text>
			<text>	2  The best option is one that is swift, unexpected, and overwhelming.</text>

			<name>Fey Step</name>

			<text>	Spring. When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet ofyou.</text>
			<text>	Summer. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet ofyou takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</text>

<subclass baseclass="Wizard" UA="Wizard Revisited">
		<name>Wizard (Theurgy)</name>
		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Tradition: Theurgy (UA)</name>
				<text>A number of deities claim arcane magic as their domain, for magic is as much a part of the fabric of the cosmos as wind, fire, lightning, and all other primal forces. Just as there are deities of the sea and gods of warfare, the arcane arts feature their own divine patrons.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Such deities often have clerics, but many gods of magic bid their followers to take up the study of wizardry. These religious magic-users follow the arcane tradition of Theurgy, and are commonly known as theurgists. Such spellcasters are as dedicated and scholarly as any other wizard, but they blend their arcane study with religious devotion.</text>
				<text>	Introduced in Unearthed Arcana: The Faithful, then revised in Wizard Revisited.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Divine Inspiration</name>
				<text>When you choose this tradition at 2nd level, choose a domain from your chosen deity's list of eligible domains (see appendix B, "Gods of the Multiverse", in the Player's Handbook for examples). The Knowledge and Light domains are especially appropriate choices for a theurgist.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Initiate</name>
				<text>Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, whenever you gain a wizard level, you can replace one of the wizard spells you add to your spellbook with a cleric domain spell for your chosen domain. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	If you add all of your domain spells to your spellbook, you can subsequently add any spell from the cleric spell list instead. The spell must still be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	Any cleric spell you gain from this feature is considered a wizard spell for you, but other wizards can't copy cleric spells from your spellbook into their own spellbooks.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Channel Arcana</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel arcane energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Arcana and the Channel Divinity option granted at 2nd level by your chosen domain. You employ that Channel Divinity option by using your Channel Arcana ability.</text>
				<text>	When you use your Channel Arcana, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Arcana again.</text>
				<text>	Some Channel Arcana effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect, the save DC equals your wizard spell save DC.</text>
				<text>	Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Arcana twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</text>
				<text>	If you gain additional Channel Divinity options from your domain, you can employ them by using your Channel Arcana feature.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Channel Arcana: Divine Arcana</name>
				<text>As a bonus action, you speak a prayer to control the flow of magic around you. The next spell you cast gains a +2 bonus to any attack roll you make for it or to its saving throw DC, as appropriate.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="6">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Acolyte</name>
				<text>At 6th level, you gain your chosen domain's 1st- level benefits. However, you do not gain any weapon or armor proficiencies from the domain.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="10">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Priest</name>
				<text>At 10th level, you gain your chosen domain's 6th-level benefits. Your faith and your understanding of magic allow you to delve into your god's secrets.</text>

		<autolevel level="14">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane High Priest</name>
				<text>At 14th level, you gain your chosen domain's 17th-level benefits. Your academic nature and understanding of magic and doctrine allow you to master this ability sooner than a cleric of your domain.</text>

				<name>Divine Domain Order</name>
				<text>The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Weejas, Aureon, Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anubis, Forseti, and Asmodeus.</text>
				<text>The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.</text>
				<text>Law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security in a chaotic multiverse.</text>

				<text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting</text>
				<text>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
				<text>You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Divine Domain</name>
				<text>Choose one domain related to your deity: Arcana, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Domain Spells</text>
				<text>Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</text>
				<text>	If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</text>

				<name>Channel Divinity</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</text>
				<text>	When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</text>
				<text>	Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</text>
				<text>	Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</name>
				<text>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</text>
				<text>	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</text>

				<text>Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.</text>
				<text>	The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.</text>
				<text>	The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</text>
				<text>	When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
				<text>	Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.</text>
				<text>	Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.</text>
				<text>	For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</text>
				<text>	Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</text>
				<text>	Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life."</text>
				<text>	Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Trait:</text>
				<text>1. I'm dauntless in the face of adversity.</text>
				<text>2. Threaten my friends, threaten me.</text>
				<text>3. I stay on alert so others can rest.</text>
				<text>4. People see an animal and underestimate me. I use that to my advantage.</text>
				<text>5. I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time.</text>
				<text>6. I put my friends' needs before my own in all things.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Flaw:</text>
				<text>1. If there's food left unattended, I'll eat it.</text>
				<text>2. I growl at strangers, and all people except my ranger are strangers to me.</text>
				<text>3. Any time is a good time for a belly rub.</text>
				<text>4. I'm deathly afraid of water.</text>
				<text>5. My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face.</text>

		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Bard College: College of Satire (UA)</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king's royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand's affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm's cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.</text>
				<text>While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.</text>
				<text>For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.</text>
				<text>Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist's treachery or exposing a baron's plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.</text>
				<text>Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies' spirits while casting doubt into foes' minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.</text>

Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your attack, saving throw, or ability check, using the new result in place of the failed one.</text>
				<text>	If using this ability grants you a success on the attack, saving throw, or ability check, note the number you rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die. The DM can then apply that result as a penalty to an attack or check you make, and you cannot use this ability again until you suffer this drawback.

		<text />
		<text>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn't need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</text>
		<text />
		<text>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</text>
		<text />
		<text>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.</text>
		<text />
		<text>If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</text>

		<name>Paladin (Redemption)</name>
		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Redemption</name>
				<text>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning them to the light, and the paladins slay them only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</text>
				<text>	While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, the paladins bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tenets of Redemption:</text>
				<text>The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Peace. Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Innocence. All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Patience. Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow it to survive and then flourish.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Wisdom. Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.</text>

The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.</text>
				<text>	You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellbook</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting</text>
				<text>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
				<text>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</text>
				<text>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar).</text>
				<text />
				<text>Your Spellbook</text>
				<text>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</text>
				<text>	Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</text>
				<text>	For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</text>
				<text>Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book— for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</text>
				<text>	If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</text>

				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Conquest</name>
				<text>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.</text>
				<text>	Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins – called hell knights – as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.</text>

You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way.

Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Magical Tinkering</name>
				<text>At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic in objects that would otherwise be mundane. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools, tinker's tools, or other artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</text>
				<text>• The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</text>
				<text>• Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</text>
				<text>• The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</text>
				<text>• A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</text>
				<text>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</text>
				<text>	You can give the magic of this feature to multiple objects, touching one object each time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>You have studied the workings of magic, how to channel it through objects, and how to awaken it within them. As a result, you have gained a limited ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders through various items.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tools Required</text>
				<text>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the Player's Handbookfor descriptions of these tools.</text>
				<text>	After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list below. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</text>
				<text>	When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent in tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + yourIntelligence modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + yourIntelligence modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting</text>
				<text>You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature>
				<name>Infuse Item</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Infusions Known</text>
				<text>When you gain this feature, pick three artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer Infusions” section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.</text>
				<text>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Infusing an Item</text>
				<text>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description.If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item, or you can forgo attunement so that someone else can attune to the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normalprocess for attunement (see “Attunement” in the Dungeon Master's Guide, page 136).</text>
				<text>Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</text>
				<text>You can infuse more than one nonmagicalobject at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</text>

				<text>	The weapon requires no ammunition; it magically produces one piece of ammunition each time you make a ranged attack with it, unless you manually load it. The ammunition produced by the weapon vanishes the instant after the it hits or misses a target.</text>

If a table has a level in its title, you must be of at least that level in this class to choose an item from the table.</text>

		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Cavalier</name>
				<text>The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Cavalier: Bonus Proficiency</name>
				<text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Cavalier: Born to the Saddle</name>
				<text>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.</text>
				<text>	Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Cavalier: Unwavering Mark</name>
				<text>Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.</text>
				<text>While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.</text>
				<text>In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.</text>
				<text>Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="7">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Cavalier: Warding Maneuver</name>
				<text>At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.</text>
				<text>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</text>

Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="15">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Cavalier: Ferocious Charger</name>
				<text>Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.</text>

You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.</text>

				<text>The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Beast Master: Ranger's Companion</name>
				<text>You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.</text>
				<text>	The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>
				<text>	If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast companion acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</text>
				<text>	Like any creature, the beast can spend hit dice during a short rest.</text>
				<text>	While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
				<text>	If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.</text>

				<name>Favored Enemy</name>
				<text>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</text>
				<text>	Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</text>
				<text>	You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</text>
				<text>	When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</text>
				<text>	You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</text>
			</feature>

				<text>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.</text>
				<text>	While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text />
				<text>• Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</text>
				<text>• Your group can't become lost except by magical means.</text>
				<text>• Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</text>

				<text>• While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
				<text>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text>	You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
			</feature>

On a failed save, the target believes one statement of your choice for the next 5 minutes that you communicate to it via telepathy. The statement can be up to ten words long, and it must describe you or a creature or an object the target can see. On a successful save, the target is unaffected, and you can't use this ability on it again until you finish a long rest. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being charmed.</text>
		<text>Broken Will (5 psi):</text>
		<text>As an action, you target one creature you can communicate with via telepathy. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw.

On a successful save, the target is unaffected, and you can't use this ability on it again until you finish a long rest. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being charmed.</text>
		<text>Psychic Grip (6 psi Conc 1m):</text>

On a failure, you can use your reaction to force the target to move up to half its speed, even though it's paralyzed.</text>

				<name>Divine Domain: Nature</name>
				<text>Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.</text>

                <name>Primal Path: Path of the Berserker</name>
                <text>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end -- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</text>

                <name>Primal Path: Path of the Totem Warrior</name>
                <text>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</text>

                <text>Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.</text>

                <text>While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes at a target within 5 feet of you.

                <text>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</text>
                <text>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</text>

                <text>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits who can guide and protect the living. When barbarians who follow this path rage, they cross the barrier into the spirit world and call on these guardian spirits for aid.</text>
                <text>	Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians fight to protect their tribes and their allies. With the spirits' help, they can hinder their foes even as they strike powerful blows against them.</text>
                <text>	In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</text>

While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn or until your rage ends, the chosen creature has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you, and if the creature takes the Disengage action within 5 feet of you, its speed is halved until the end of its turn.</text>

                <text>Typical barbarians harbor a fury that dwells within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn instead to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into nature to create powerful, magical effects.</text>
                <text>	Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect the natural realm. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges founded in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</text>

                <text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</text>
                <text />
                <text>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</text>
                <text />
                <text>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</text>

These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</text>

                <text>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</text>
                <text>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade’s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust them.</text>
                <text>Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most performer troupes. With their weapon skills as their greatest asset, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves’ guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</text>

                <name>Bard College: College of Satire (UA)</name>
                <text>Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king’s royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand’s affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm’s cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.</text>
                <text>While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester’s barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.</text>
                <text>For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester’s satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.</text>
                <text>Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist’s treachery or exposing a baron’s plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.</text>
                <text>Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies’ spirits while casting doubt into foes’ minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.</text>

                <text>	As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous, otherworldly appearance. When you do so, choose a number of allies you can see and who can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number of them equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target gains 2d6 temporary hit points. </text>
                <text>	When a target gains these temporary hit points, it can also use its reaction to move up to its speed toward you, without provoking opportunity attacks. It must take the shortest, safest path to you. </text>

At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number of them equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who speaks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, avoiding violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. </text>

                <text>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats. </text>
                <text>	Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bards' reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, these bards rarely reveal their true nature unless they must. They typically claim to follow some other college, or keep their true nature secret in order to better infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</text>

                <text>	If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 10 minutes, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened for the next hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. While frightened in this way, the target is paranoid and tries to avoid the company of others, including its allies. The target seeks out what it considers the safest, most secret place available to it and hides there. </text>

                <text>	During that hour, you gain access to all information that the creature would freely share with a casual acquaintance.

                <text>	As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't hear you.

                <text>	While charmed in this way, the creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend. </text>

                <text>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
                <text>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
                <text>    You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
                <text>    For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
                <text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>

                <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
                <text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
                <text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

                <text>The gods of knowledge - including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth - value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</text>

                <text>    As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.

                <text>    As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.</text>
                <text>    For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses.

                <text>The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can transform from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities quest to search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</text>

                <text>Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse's workings. To resist death, or to desecrate the dead's rest, is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. These deities teach their followers to respect the dead and pay them due homage. Followers of these deities seek to put restless spirits to rest, destroy the undead wherever they find them, and ease the suffering of dying creatures. Their magic also allows them to stave off a creature's death, though they refuse to use such magic to extend a creature's lifespan beyond its mortal limits.</text>

                <text>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
                <text>    You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
                <text>    For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level ar 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
                <text>    You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>

                <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
                <text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
                <text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
                <text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

                <text>    You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</text>
                <text>    While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</text>
                <text>• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</text>
                <text>• When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</text>
                <text>• You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</text>
                <text>• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</text>
                <text>• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</text>

                <text>Known Beast Shapes: </text>
                <text>	When you gain the Wild Shape feature at 2nd level, you are deeply familiar with three beasts of your choice and can transform into them. </text>
                <text>	To choose the three beast shapes, you first need to determine whether your druid grew up in a temperate or a tropical region, consulting with your DM. Then refer to the Common Beast Shapes table that corresponds to the region you selected. That table lists the beasts you can choose from, based on your druid level. The table presents the animals that a druid is most likely to have seen as a novice, to have learned about through mystic research, or to have a special affinity with. </text>
                <text>	Each time you gain a druid level later, you can choose one more beast shape from the same table you used at 2nd level.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Gaining Beast Shapes:</text>
                <text>	In addition to the beast shapes you gain for free when you level up, you can acquire new shapes on your adventures. Do you see a dinosaur, a saber-toothed tiger, a giant eagle, or some other exotic critter that you want to turn into? This rule gives you a method for learning how to do so. It requires you to abide by the limitations in the Wild Shape feature (see the Beast Shapes table in the Player's Handbook, page 66). </text>
                <text>	When you see a beast whose shape you'd like to learn, you have two options: </text>
                <text />
                <text>Observation: </text>
                <text>	You learn the beast's shape after observing its behavior for at least 1 hour and succeeding on an Intelligence (Nature) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast's challenge rating. For this observation period, your vantage point—whether physical or magical— must be within 150 feet of the beast. If you previously spent at least 1 hour reading a scholarly work about the creature, you have advantage on the check. </text>
                <text />
                <text>Interaction: </text>
                <text>	You learn the beast's shape after interacting with it peacefully for 10 minutes and succeeding on a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast's challenge rating. For this interaction period, you must be within 15 feet of the beast, and if you spend at least a minute petting it, you have advantage on the check. </text>
                <text />
                <text>	Either of these options can be assisted by magic. For example, divination magic can be used to provide safe observation of a dangerous animal, and a spell like animal friendship can lay the groundwork for peaceful interaction.</text>

                <text />
                <text>Hawk: The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, marking your enemies with its keen sight. You and your allies gain advantage on ranged attack rolls against targets in the spirit's aura. </text>
                <text />
                <text>Wolf: The wolf spirit lends you and your allies its precise senses, while your magic works to benefit the members of your pack. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores hit points to anyone inside or outside the aura, each of your allies in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level. </text>

                <name>Circle of Twilight: Harvest's Scythe</name>
                <text>Starting at 2nd level, you learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your spells to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level. </text>
                <text>	When you roll damage for a spell, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. You can spend a number of dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as necrotic damage. If you kill one or more hostile creatures with a spell augmented in this way, you or an ally of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you regains 2 hit points per die spent to increase the spell's damage, or 5 hit points per die if at least one of the slain creatures was undead. </text>

                <text>	You can also use this feature to teleport someone else. As an action, you can teleport a willing ally you touch up to 30 feet to a point you can see. </text>

To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</text>

                <text>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic - abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</text>

They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to guide them in defeating evildoers.</text>
                <text>    A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</text>
                <text>    A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight's actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</text>

                <text>Spell Slots</text>
                <text>The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
                <text>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</text>

                <text>    Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</text>

                <text>    You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</text>
                <text>    When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</text>
                <text>    Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

                <text>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees.

        <text>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</text>
        <text />
        <text>If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</text>
        <text />
        <text>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn't need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</text>
        <text />
        <text>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</text>
        <text />
        <text>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.</text>
        <text />

For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.</text>

                <text>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline’s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.</text>
                <text>    You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn’t limit your ability to use other disciplines.</text>

                <name>Using Disciplines</name>
                <text>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.</text>
                <text>    The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Psychic Focus</text>
                <text>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Effect Options and Psi Points</text>
                <text>A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don’t have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can’t use the option.</text>
                <text>    Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline’s potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can’t decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.</text>
                <text>    Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Components</text>
                <text>Disciplines don’t require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Duration</text>
                <text>    An option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts. Instantaneous: If no duration is specified, the effect of an option is instantaneous. Concentration: Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with “Conc” after the option’s psi point cost. The “Conc” notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says “Conc 1m”, you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute, if an option says “Conc 1h,” you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 hour, and finally if an option says "Conc 1r", you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 round.</text>
                <text>    Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can’t concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” in the Player’s Handbook for how concentration works.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Targets and Areas of Effect</text>
                <text>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect. See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the Player’s Handbook.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</text>
                <text>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.</text>
                <text>Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline’s effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Combining Psionic Effects</text>
                <text>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of those disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a single psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn’t combine with itself if that option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect — usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect — applies while the durations of the effects overlap.</text>
                <text>    Psionics and magic are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule (see “Psionics and Magic” earlier, as well as “Combining Magical Effects” in chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the Player’s Handbook).</text>

        <text>As a student of psionic power, you perceive the potential energy that flows through all things. You reach out with your mind, transforming the potential into the actual. Objects and creatures move at your command.</text>
        <text>Psychic Focus:</text>
        <text>While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Strength checks.</text>
        <text>Push (1–7 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 force damage per psi point spent and is pushed up to 5 feet per point spent in a straight line away from you. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</text>
        <text>Move (2–7 psi):</text>
        <text>Choose one object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature and that isn’t secured in place. It can’t be larger than 20 feet on a side, and its maximum weight depends on the psi points spent on this ability, as shown below.</text>
        <text>As an action, you move the object up to 60 feet, and you must keep the object within sight during this movement. If the object ends this movement in the air, it falls. If the object would fall on a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take damage as listed on the table below.</text>

        <text>Inertial Armor (2 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, you sheathe yourself in an intangible field of magical force. For 8 hours, your base AC is 14 + your Dexterity modifier, and you gain resistance to force damage. This effect ends if you are wearing or don armor.</text>
        <text>Telekinetic Barrier (3 psi Conc 10m):</text>
        <text>As an action, you create a transparent wall of telekinetic energy, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 40 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 inch thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Each 10-foot section of the wall has an AC of 10 and 10 hit points.</text>
        <text>Grasp (3 psi Conc 1m):</text>
        <text>You attempt to grasp a creature in telekinetic energy and hold it captive. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be grappled by you until your concentration ends or until the target leaves your reach, which is 60 feet for this grapple.</text>
        <text>The grappled target can escape by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your psionic ability plus your proficiency bonus. When a target attempts to escape in this way, you can spend psi points to boost your check, abiding by your psi limit. You gain a +1 bonus per psi point spent.</text>
        <text>While a target is grappled in this manner, you create one of the following effects as an action:</text>
        <text>Crush (1–7 psi):</text>
        <text>The target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per psi point spent.</text>
        <text>Move (1–7 psi):</text>

        <text>Ice Sheet (2 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, choose a point on the ground you can see within 60 feet of you. The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point becomes covered in ice for 10 minutes. It is difficult terrain, and any creature that moves more than 10 feet on it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If the surface is sloped, a creature that falls prone in the area immediately slides to the bottom of the slope.</text>
        <text>Frozen Sanctuary (3 psi):</text>
        <text>As a bonus action, you sheathe yourself with icy resilience. You gain 20 temporary hit points.</text>
        <text>Frozen Rain (5 psi Conc 1m):</text>
        <text>As an action, choose a point you can see within 120 feet of you. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point becomes deathly cold and saturated with moisture. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d6 cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</text>
        <text>    As an action, a target that has its speed reduced can end the effect early if it succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to this effect’s save DC.</text>

        <text>Psychic Focus:</text>

        <text>Darkness (1–7 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, you create an area of magical darkness, which foils darkvision. Choose a spot you can see within 60 feet of you. Magical darkness radiates from that point in a sphere with a 10-foot radius per psi point spent on this ability. The light produced by spells of 2nd level or less is suppressed in this area.</text>
        <text>Light (2 psi Conc 1m):</text>
        <text>As an action, an object you touch radiates light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light lasts until your concentration ends. Alternatively, a creature you touch radiates light in the same manner if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. While lit in this manner, it can’t hide, and attack rolls against it gain advantage.</text>
        <text>Shadow Beasts (3 psi Conc 1m):</text>
        <text>As an action, you cause two shadows to appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within 60 feet of you. The shadows last until your concentration ends, and they obey your verbal commands. In combat, roll for their initiative, and choose their behavior during their turns. When this effect ends, the shadows disappear. See the Monster Manual for their stat block.</text>
        <text>    As an action, a target that has its speed reduced can end the effect early if it succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to this effect’s save DC.</text>

        <text>Desiccate (1–7 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 1d10 necrotic damage per psi point spent on this ability, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
        <text>Watery Grasp (2 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, you unleash a wave that surges forth and then retreats to you like the rising tide. You create a wave in a 20-foot-by-20-foot square. At least some portion of the square’s border must be within 5 feet of you. Any creature in that square must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is pulled up to 10 feet closer to you. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. You can increase this ability’s damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.</text>
        <text>Water Whip (3 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, you unleash a jet of water in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide.

        <text>As an action, you cause a sphere of water to form around a creature. Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes trapped in the sphere of water until your concentration ends. While the target is trapped, its speed is halved, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, and it can’t see anything more than 10 feet away from it. However, attack rolls against it also suffer disadvantage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful one.</text>
        <text>Animate Water (7 psi; Conc, 1h):</text>
        <text>As an action, you cause a water elemental to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you.

If the creature is on another plane of existence, you instead learn which plane.</text>

For the next 8 hours, whenever you use this psionic discipline to teleport, you can instead teleport to the anchor, even if you can’t see it, but it must be within range of the teleportation ability.</text>
        <text>Defensive Step (2 psi):</text>

        <text>As an action, you create a 5-foot cube of dim, gray light within 5 feet of you.

        <text>Occluded Mind (2 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, you target one creature you can communicate with via telepathy. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes one statement of your choice for the next 5 minutes that you communicate to it via telepathy. The statement can be up to ten words long, and it must describe you or a creature or an object the target can see. On a successful save, the target is unaffected, and you can’t use this ability on it again until you finish a long rest. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being charmed.</text>
        <text>Broken Will (5 psi):</text>

        <text>Psychic Grip (6 psi Conc 1m):</text>
        <text>As an action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or it is paralyzed until your concentration ends.

                <text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
                <text>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
                <text>    You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
                <text>    For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
                <text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>

In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

                <text>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things - leaves, antlers, or flowers - to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</text>

                <text>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</text>
                <text>    Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</text>
                <text>    Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</text>
                <text>    Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.</text>
                <text>    Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</text>
            </feature>
            <feature optional="YES">
                <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Devotion</name>
                <text>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels - the perfect servants of good - as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</text>

                <text />
                <text>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</text>
                <text>    Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</text>
                <text>    Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</text>
                <text>    Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</text>
                <text>    Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</text>
                <text>    Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</text>
            </feature>
            <feature optional="YES">
                <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Vengeance</name>
                <text>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside - at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins - sometimes called avengers or dark knights - their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Tenets of Vengeance: The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</text>
                <text>    Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.</text>
                <text>    No Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</text>
                <text>    By Any Means Necessary. My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.</text>
                <text>    Restitution. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</text>

                <text>The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.</text>

                <text>Tenets of the Crown:</text>
                <text>    The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Law: The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Loyalty: Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Courage: You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?</text>
                <text />
                <text>Responsibility: You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations. </text>

As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</text>

                <text>    Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.</text>
                <text>    In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.</text>

                <text>• Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</text>
                <text>• You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.</text>

                <text>At 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround himself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.</text>
                <text>    While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + the paladin's Charisma modifier.</text>
                <text>    After activating the aura, the paladin can't do so again until he or she finishes a long rest.</text>

                <text>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. </text>
                <text>	Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might. Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells. </text>
                <text>	The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins-called hell knights-as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. </text>

                <text>Tenets of Conquest: </text>
                <text>	A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm. A hell knight's oath appears in Infernal runes, a brutal reminder of vows to the Lords of Hell. </text>
                <text />
                <text>Douse the Flame of Hope: It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire. </text>
                <text />
                <text>Rule with an Iron Fist: Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow. </text>

                <text>Strength Above All: You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin. </text>

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can also use your Channel Divinity to force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw.

                <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Treachery</name>
                <text>The Oath of Treachery is the path followed by paladins who have forsworn other oaths or who care only for their own power and survival. Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure. </text>
                <text>	Many of these paladins pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz't and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard's penchant for double dealing and treachery. </text>
                <text />
                <text>Fallen Paladins: </text>
                <text>	The Oath of Treachery is an option for the paladin who has strayed from another Sacred Oath or who has rejected the traditional paladin life. This option exists alongside the Oathbreaker in the Dungeon Master's Guide. DMs are free to use either option to model villainous or fallen paladins. </text>
                <text>	If you switch to this oath from another one, replace all of the previous oath's features with the features of this one, and if you renounce this oath, replace its features with the features of the new one. </text>
                <text />
                <text>Tenets of Treachery: </text>
                <text>	A paladin who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one. There are no tenets of this oath, for it lacks any substance. Those who are unfortunate enough to have close contact with blackguards have observed that a blackguard's overwhelming concern is power and safety, especially if both can be obtained at the expense of others. </text>

                <name>Oath of Treachery Channel Divinity: Conjure Duplicate (Oath of Treachery)</name>
                <text>As an action, you create a visual illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, and doesn't occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but the illusion must remain within 120 feet of you. </text>
                <text>	For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses.

                <name>Spellcasting</name>
                <text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. </text>

                <text>Spell Slots</text>
                <text>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
                <text>    For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>
                <text />

                <text>    You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
                <text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>

                <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
                <text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
                <text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
                <text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

                <text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. </text>

                <text>Spell Slots: </text>
                <text>	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </text>
                <text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>

                <text>	At each odd level, you learn an additional ranger spell of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. </text>
                <text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>

                <text>Spellcasting Ability: </text>
                <text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </text>
                <text />
                <text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </text>

                <text>Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you. </text>
                <text>	You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. </text>
                <text>	You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes. </text>
                <text>	Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures' general direction and distance (in miles) from you. </text>

                <text>	With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area. </text>

                <text>	If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. </text>

                <text>	Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. </text>
                <text>	Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws. </text>
                <text>	For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. </text>
                <text>	Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

                <text>Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix's power dwells within you.</text>
                <text>	That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can't bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.</text>
                <text>	More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.</text>
                <text>	Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.</text>

                <text>    Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a succesful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.</text>

                <text>Spell Slots</text>
                <text>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
                <text>    For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</text>

                <text>    You learn a new warlock spell every time you gain a level from 2 through 9, as well as at level 19. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</text>
                <text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>

                <text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

                <text>    At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice.</text>
                <text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in an invocation refers to warlock level, not character level.</text>

You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</text>
                <text>    Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</text>
                <text>    You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</text>

The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</text>

You are driven to bring light to dark places, to annihilate undead creatures, and to protect all living things.

These weapons grow stronger as they consume the life essence of their victims. The strongest of them can use their ties to the Shadowfell to offer power to mortals who serve them. The Raven Queen forged the first of these weapons. They, along with the hexblade warlocks, are another tool she can use to manipulate events in the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.</text>

                <text>	Your patron could be any deity or other powerful entity dedicated to knowledge or forgotten lore. Celestian is an ideal patron for a Greyhawk campaign, and was the inspiration for this concept. In the Forgotten Realms, your patron might be Azuth or Oghma. Aureon makes an excellent patron in Eberron, while in Krynn and the Dragonlance campaign setting, Gilean is a good match for the Seeker's role.</text>

The Raven Queen watches over the world, anticipating each creature’s death and ensuring that it meets its end at the proscribed time and place. As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed, dark reflection of the world. Her ability to reach into the world is limited. Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will. Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning them of impending dangers.</text>
                <text>    The Raven Queen’s followers are expected to serve her will in the world. She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations of immortality. She hates intelligent undead and expects her followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons in her eyes.</text>

                <text>	The Seeker grants you a chain forged from starlight, decorated with seven gleaming motes of brightness. While the chain is on your person, you know the augury spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.</text>

As a bonus action, you can command it to magically slip into the shadow of a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. While the shadow hound is merged in this manner, the target can’t gain the benefits of half cover or three-quarters cover against your attack rolls, and you know the distance and direction to the target even if it is hidden. The hound can’t be seen by anyone but you and those with truesight, and it is unaffected by light. The target has a vague feeling of dread while the hound is present.</text>
                <text>    As a bonus action, you can command your shadow hound to return to you. It also automatically returns to you if you and the target are on different planes of existence, if you’re incapacitated, or if dispel magic, remove curse, or similar magic is used on the target.</text>

                <text>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</text>
                <text>    For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.</text>
                <text>    You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</text>
            </feature>
            <feature>
                <name>Spellcasting</name>
                <text>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Cantrips</text>
                <text>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Spellbook</text>
                <text>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
                <text>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
                <text>    You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
                <text>    For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
                <text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
                <text>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
                <text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
                <text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
                <text />
                <text>Ritual Casting</text>
                <text>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
                <text>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</text>

                <text>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Bladesinging, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</text>

            <feature optional="YES">
                <name>Arcane Tradition: Abjuration</name>
                <text>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.</text>

                <name>Arcane Tradition: Bladesinger</name>
                <text>Bladesingers are elves who bravely defend their people and lands. They are elf wizards who master a school of sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense.</text>

You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.</text>

                <name>Arcane Tradition: Divination</name>
                <text>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.</text>

                <text>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.</text>

                <text>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</text>

                <text>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists - including many gnome wizards - are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</text>

                <name>Arcane Tradition: Transmutation</name>

You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</text>

                <name>Arcane Tradition: Necromancy</name>
                <text>The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.</text>

When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</text>
                <text>    While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.</text>

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn.

		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Arcane Archer</name>
				<text>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Archer: Arcane Archer's Lore</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature – typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the Prestidigitation or Druidcraft cantrip.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Archer: Arcane Shot</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options" below).</text>
				<text>	Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>	You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Archer: Arcane Shot Options</name>
				<text>The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.</text>
				<text>	If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Banishing Arrow. You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</text>
				<text>	After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Beguiling Arrow. Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.</text>
				<text>	The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Bursting Arrow. You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The arrow detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.</text>
				<text>	The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Enfeebling Arrow. You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text>	The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Grasping Arrow. When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</text>
				<text>	The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Piercing Arrow. You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</text>
				<text>	The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Seeking Arrow. Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.</text>
				<text>	The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Shadow Arrow:</text>
				<text>Shadow Arrow. You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text>	The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</text>
			</feature>

		<autolevel level="7">

				<name>Arcane Archer: Magic Arrow</name>
				<text>At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Archer: Curving Shot</name>
				<text>At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.</text>

		<name>Paladin (Treachery)</name>
		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Treachery (UA)</name>
				<text>The Oath of Treachery is the path followed by paladins who have forsworn other oaths or who care only for their own power and survival. Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure.</text>
				<text>	Many of these paladins pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz't and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard's penchant for double dealing and treachery.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Fallen Paladins:</text>
				<text>	The Oath of Treachery is an option for the paladin who has strayed from another Sacred Oath or who has rejected the traditional paladin life. This option exists alongside the Oathbreaker in the Dungeon Master's Guide. DMs are free to use either option to model villainous or fallen paladins.</text>
				<text>	If you switch to this oath from another one, replace all of the previous oath's features with the features of this one, and if you renounce this oath, replace its features with the features of the new one.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tenets of Treachery:</text>
				<text>	A paladin who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one. There are no tenets of this oath, for it lacks any substance. Those who are unfortunate enough to have close contact with blackguards have observed that a blackguard's overwhelming concern is power and safety, especially if both can be obtained at the expense of others.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Oath Spells:</text>
				<text>	You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</text>
				<text>3rd - charm person, expeditious retreat</text>
				<text>5th - invisibility, mirror image</text>
				<text>9th - gaseous form, haste</text>
				<text>13th - confusion, greater invisibility</text>
				<text>17th - dominate person, passwall</text>
				<text />
				<text>This Sacred Oath is from Unearthed Arcana: Paladin Sacred Oaths, and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this option.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Oath of Treachery Channel Divinity: Conjure Duplicate (Oath of Treachery)</name>
				<text>As an action, you create a visual illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, and doesn't occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but the illusion must remain within 120 feet of you.</text>
				<text>	For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Oath of Treachery Channel Divinity: Poison Strike (Oath of Treachery)</name>
				<text>You can use your Channel Divinity to make a weapon deadlier. As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and conjure a special poison on it. The poison lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition, the target takes poison damage immediately after the attack. The poison damage equals 2d10 + your paladin level, or 20 + your paladin level if you had advantage on the attack roll.</text>

				<text>	You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or more of its allies within 5 feet of it.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Treacherous Strike:</text>
				<text>	If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll that attack against a creature of your choice that is also within 5 feet of the attacker. The ability fails and is wasted if the attacker is immune to being charmed.</text>

				<text />
				<text>• You are invisible.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• If a creature damages you on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to your spell save DC) or you control its next action, provided that you aren't incapacitated when it takes the action. A creature automatically succeeds on the save if the creature is immune to being charmed.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• If you have advantage on an attack roll, you gain a bonus to its damage roll equal to your paladin level.</text>

				<name>Martial Archetype: Eldritch Knight</name>
				<text>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic - abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</text>

				<name>Eldritch Knight: Spellcasting</name>
				<text>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>

				<text>Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse's workings. To resist death, or to desecrate the dead's rest, is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. These deities teach their followers to respect the dead and pay them due homage. Followers of these deities seek to put restless spirits to rest, destroy the undead wherever they find them, and ease the suffering of dying creatures. Their magic also allows them to stave off a creature's death, though they refuse to use such magic to extend a creature's lifespan beyond its mortal limits.</text>

Known as wu jens, these mystics cast their minds into the world, seize control of its fundamental principles, and rebuild it.</text>
				<text>	In practical terms, wu jens excel at controlling the forces of the natural world. They can hurl objects with their minds, control the four elements, and alter reality to fit their desires.</text>

		<text>Your mind reaches into the sky, reshaping the stuff of storms to serve your needs.</text>
		<text>Psychic Focus:</text>
		<text>While focused on this discipline, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage.</text>
		<text>Cloud Steps (1–7 psi Conc 10m):</text>
		<text>As an action, you conjure forth clouds to create a solid, translucent staircase that lasts until your concentration ends. The stairs form a spiral that fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot area and reaches upward 20 feet per psi point spent.</text>
		<text>Hungry Lightning (1–7 psi):</text>
		<text>As an action, you lash out at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you with tendrils of lightning. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if it's wearing heavy armor. The target takes 1d8 lightning damage per psi point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
		<text>Wall of Clouds (2 psi Conc 10m):</text>
		<text>As an action, you create a wall of clouds, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Creatures can pass through it without hindrance, but the wall blocks vision.</text>
		<text>Whirlwind (2 psi):</text>
		<text>As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Winds howl in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and be moved to an unoccupied space of your choice in the sphere. Any loose object in the sphere is moved to an unoccupied space of your choice within it if the object weighs no more than 100 pounds.</text>
		<text>Wall of Thunder (6 psi Conc 10m):</text>
		<text>As an action, you create a wall of thunder, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Every foot moved through the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature moves into the wall's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or it takes 6d6 thunder damage, is pushed in a straight line up to 30 feet away from the wall, and is knocked prone.</text>
		<text>Thunder Clap (7 psi):</text>
		<text>As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Thunder energy erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d6 thunder damage, and it is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</text>

		<text>You attune your mind to seize control of wood and earth.</text>
		<text>Psychic Focus:</text>
		<text>While focused on this discipline, you have a +1 bonus to AC.</text>
		<text>Animate Weapon (1–7 psi):</text>
		<text>As an action, your mind seizes control of a one-handed melee weapon you're holding. The weapon flies toward one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and makes a one-handed melee weapon attack against it, using your discipline attack modifier for the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, the weapon deals its normal damage, plus an extra 1d10 force damage per psi point spent on this ability. The weapon returns to your grasp after it attacks.</text>
		<text>Warp Weapon (2 psi):</text>
		<text>As an action, choose one nonmagical weapon held by one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or the chosen weapon can't be used to attack until the end of your next turn.</text>
		<text>Warp Armor (3 psi):</text>
		<text>As an action, choose a nonmagical suit of armor worn by one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the creature's AC becomes 10 + its Dexterity modifier until the end of your next turn.</text>
		<text>Wall of Wood (3 psi Conc 1h):</text>
		<text>As an action, you create a wall of wood at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Each 5-foot wide section of the wall has AC 12 and 100 hit points. Breaking one section creates a 5-foot by 5-foot hole in it, but the wall otherwise remains intact.</text>
		<text>Armored Form (6 psi Conc 1m):</text>
		<text>As a bonus action, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, which lasts until your concentration ends.</text>
		<text>Animate Earth (7 psi Conc 1h):</text>
		<text>As an action, you cause an earth elemental to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The elemental lasts until your concentration ends, and it obeys your verbal commands. In combat, roll for its initiative, and choose its behavior during its turns. When this effect ends, the elemental disappears. See the Monster Manual for its stat block.</text>

				<text>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</text>

				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level ar 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting</text>
				<text>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
				<text>You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells</text>
			</feature>

				<name>Wild Shape</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>	Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Beast Shapes</text>
				<text>Level  Max. CR   Limitations                    Example</text>
				<text>2nd    1/4       No flying or swimming speed    Wolf</text>
				<text>4th    1/2       No flying speed                Crocodile</text>
				<text>8th    1         —                              Giant eagle</text>
				<text />
				<text>	You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</text>
				<text>	While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</text>
				<text>• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</text>
				<text>• When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</text>
				<text>• You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</text>
				<text>• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</text>
				<text>• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</text>

				<name>Optional Rule: Wild Shape Forms</name>
				<text>Known Beast Shapes:</text>
				<text>	When you gain the Wild Shape feature at 2nd level, you are deeply familiar with three beasts of your choice and can transform into them.</text>
				<text>	To choose the three beast shapes, you first need to determine whether your druid grew up in a temperate or a tropical region, consulting with your DM. Then refer to the Common Beast Shapes table that corresponds to the region you selected. That table lists the beasts you can choose from, based on your druid level. The table presents the animals that a druid is most likely to have seen as a novice, to have learned about through mystic research, or to have a special affinity with.</text>
				<text>	Each time you gain a druid level later, you can choose one more beast shape from the same table you used at 2nd level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Gaining Beast Shapes:</text>
				<text>	In addition to the beast shapes you gain for free when you level up, you can acquire new shapes on your adventures. Do you see a dinosaur, a saber-toothed tiger, a giant eagle, or some other exotic critter that you want to turn into? This rule gives you a method for learning how to do so. It requires you to abide by the limitations in the Wild Shape feature (see the Beast Shapes table in the Player's Handbook, page 66).</text>
				<text>	When you see a beast whose shape you'd like to learn, you have two options:</text>
				<text />
				<text>Observation:</text>
				<text>	You learn the beast's shape after observing its behavior for at least 1 hour and succeeding on an Intelligence (Nature) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast's challenge rating. For this observation period, your vantage point—whether physical or magical— must be within 150 feet of the beast. If you previously spent at least 1 hour reading a scholarly work about the creature, you have advantage on the check.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Interaction:</text>
				<text>	You learn the beast's shape after interacting with it peacefully for 10 minutes and succeeding on a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast's challenge rating. For this interaction period, you must be within 15 feet of the beast, and if you spend at least a minute petting it, you have advantage on the check.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Either of these options can be assisted by magic. For example, divination magic can be used to provide safe observation of a dangerous animal, and a spell like animal friendship can lay the groundwork for peaceful interaction.</text>
				<text />
				<text>This optional rule is from Unearthed Arcana: Druid Circles and Wild Shape, and as such may not be used in your game. Consult your DM about this rule.</text>

		<name>Warlock (Raven Queen)</name>
		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Raven Queen (UA)</name>
				<text>You patron is the Raven Queen, a mysterious being who rules the Shadowfell from a palace of ice deep within that dread realm. The Raven Queen watches over the world, anticipating each creature's death and ensuring that it meets its end at the proscribed time and place. As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed, dark reflection of the world. Her ability to reach into the world is limited. Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will. Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning them of impending dangers.</text>
				<text>	The Raven Queen's followers are expected to serve her will in the world. She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations of immortality. She hates intelligent undead and expects her followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons in her eyes.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Expanded Spell List: The Raven Queen lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</text>
				<text />
				<text>1st - false life, sanctuary</text>
				<text />
				<text>2nd - silence, spiritual weapon</text>
				<text />
				<text>3rd - feign death, speak with dead</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>The Raven Queen: Sentinel Raven</name>
				<text>Starting at 1st level, you gain the service of a spirit sent by the Raven Queen to watch over you. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you.</text>
				<text>	While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can't be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can't take damage; and it is incapacitated.</text>
				<text>	You can see through the raven's eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you.</text>
				<text>	In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours.</text>
				<text>	The raven doesn't require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you from sleep as a bonus action.</text>
				<text>	The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles.</text>
				<text>	At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you—no matter where it is or whether it died—and it reappears within 5 feet of you.</text>

		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="6">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>The Raven Queen: Soul of the Raven</name>
				<text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to merge with your raven spirit. As a bonus action when your raven is perched on your shoulder, your body merges with your raven's form. While merged, you become Tiny, you replace your speed with the raven's, and you can use your action only to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, or Search. During this time, you gain the benefits of your raven being perched on your shoulder. As an action, you and the raven return to normal.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Tradition: Invention (UA)</name>
				<text>The School of Invention claims credit for inventing the other schools of magic—a claim other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school push magic to its limits. They stretch the known laws of arcane power and strive to reveal important truths about the nature of the multiverse.</text>
				<text>	Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. They have a reputation for acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study, rigorous practice, and endless hours of repetition. These wizards would rather throw spells together and see what happens.</text>
				<text>	Many wizards of this tradition are gnomes, alchemists, or both, and they take pride in the magic-infused armor they don. The armor not only provides protection, but it is also designed to help the wizard channel magic in unpredictable ways.</text>
				<text>	Wizards of this tradition are regarded as savants to their faces, but wizards of other traditions often think of them as lunatics.</text>
				<text>This aracane tradition is from Unearthed Arcana: Three Subclasses and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this class option.</text>

				<text>Innovation is a dangerous practice, at least as far as members of this school practice it. As a shield against this risk, you have developed a suit of arcane armor.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor and gain a suit of arcanomechanical armor—a magic item that only you can attune to. While you are attuned to it and wearing it, it grants you resistance to force damage.</text>
				<text>	The armor is light armor and provides an AC of 12 + your Dexterity modifier. It weighs 8 pounds.</text>
				<text>	You can create a new suit of it at the end of a long rest by touching a nonmagical suit of studded leather armor, which magically transforms it. Doing so removes the magic from your previous arcanomechanical armor, turning it into nonmagical studded leather.</text>

				<text>• Expend a spell slot and roll twice on the Reckless Casting table for its level, or the 5th level table if the slot is 6th level or higher. Pick which of the two results you want to use and cast the resulting spell as part of this action.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>School of Invention: Alchemical Casting</name>
				<text>At 6th level, you learn to channel magic through your arcanomechanical armor to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell while wearing that armor and attuned to it, you can expend one additional spell slot of 1st or 2ndlevel to alter the spell. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.</text>
				<text>	A 1st-level slot allows you to manipulate the spell's energy. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type for another one from that list.</text>
				<text>	A 2nd-level slot increases the spell's raw force.  If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase that damage by 2d10 force damage against one of the spell's targets (your choice) this turn.</text>

				<name>Divine Domain: Trickery</name>
				<text>Gods of trickery - such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki - are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Trickery Domain Spells: At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.</text>

				<text>	As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.</text>
				<text>	For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots:</text>
				<text>	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>

These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels.

				<text>	Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</text>

		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Otherworldly Patron: The Hexblade</name>
				<text>You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell – a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.</text>
				<text>	Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Expanded Spell List: The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</text>
				<text />
				<text>1st - shield, wrathful smite</text>
				<text />
				<text>2nd - blur, branding smite</text>
				<text />
				<text>3rd - blink, elemental weapon</text>

				<name>The Hexblade: Hexblade's Curse</name>
				<text>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text>• You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.</text>
				<text>• Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</text>
				<text>• If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).</text>
				<text>You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>The Hexblade: Hex Warrior</name>
				<text>At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</text>
				<text>	The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.</text>

				<name>The Hexblade: Shadow Hound</name>
				<text>Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).</text>
				<text>	The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.</text>
				<text>	Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.</text>

When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously cursed creature.</text>

				<text>A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster's spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.</text>
				<text>	Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them.</text>
				<text>	In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage's typical response: "What good is being able to throw a mighty Fireball if I die before I can cast it?"</text>

To these paladins - sometimes called avengers or dark knights - their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</text>

				<text>Tenets of Vengeance: The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</text>
