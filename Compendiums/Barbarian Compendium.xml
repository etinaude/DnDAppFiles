				<name>Rage</name>
				<text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</text>
				<text>	While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</text>
				<text />
				<text>• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
				<text>• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.</text>
				<text>• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
				<text />
				<text>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</text>
				<text>	Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</text>
				<text>	Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.  You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</text>

				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Ancestral Guardian</name>
				<text>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.</text>
				<text>Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Path of the Ancestral Guardian: Ancestral Protectors</name>
				<text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</text>

Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</text>

				<text>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.</text>
				<text>	Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</text>

Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.</text>
				<text>	If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</text>

				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Wild Soul (UA)</name>
				<text>The realm of the Feywild abounds with beauty, unpredictable emotion, and rampant magic. A barbarian exposed to this realm feels emotions powerfully and magic saturates their body.</text>
				<text>	When a barbarian who follows this path rages, it is a bellowing roar for freedom, an explosion of expression, manifesting in unpredictable ways. </text>
				<text />
				<text>This Primal Path is from Unearthed Arcana: Barbarian and Monk, and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this option.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Path of the Wild Soul: Lingering Magic</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, your body reacts to the presence of magic. You can cast the detect magic spell without using a spell slot or components. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. You faintly glow a color corresponding to the school of magic you detect (you choose the colors). </text>
				<text>	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.)</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Path of the Wild Soul: Wild Surge</name>
				<text>Starting at 3rd level, magic erupts from you as you rage. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Surge table to determine the magical effect produced.</text>
				<text>	If the wild surge requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Wild Surge</text>
				<text>d8   Effect</text>
				<text>1    Necrotic energy bursts from you. Each creature within 30 feet of you takes 1d10 necrotic damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the sum of the necrotic damage dealt to the creatures.</text>
				<text>2    You teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until your rage ends, you can activate this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.</text>
				<text>3    You conjure 1d4 intangible spirits that look like flumphs in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of you. Each spirit immediately flies 30 feet in a random direction. At the end of your turn, all spirits explode and each creature within 5 feet of one or more of them must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 force damage.</text>
				<text>4    Arcane energy enshrouds you. Until your rage ends, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, that creature takes force damage equal to your Constitution modifier.</text>
				<text>5    Plant life temporarily grows around you: until your rage ends, the ground within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain.</text>
				<text>6    Arcane energy taps into the minds of those around you. Each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or you see a glimpse of the creature's thoughts, learning how it plans to attack you. As a result, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text>7    Shadows weave around a weapon of your choice you are holding. Until your rage ends, your weapon deals psychic damage instead of its bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, and it gains the light and thrown properties with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If you drop the weapon or throw it, the weapon dissipates and reappears in your hand at the end of your turn.</text>
				<text>8    A beam of brilliant light lances from your chest in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 radiant damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn.</text>

				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Zealot</name>
				<text>Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots – warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.</text>
				<text>	A variety of gods across the worlds of D&amp;D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.</text>

				<name>Path of the Zealot: Divine Fury</name>
				<text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes.

				<name>Path of the Zealot: Rage Beyond Death</name>
				<text>Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.</text>
				<text>	While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.</text>
